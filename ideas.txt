- While Torch God's Favor is active, you not have a new option to turn all biome torches and campfires you pick up into the default Torch/Campfire to save inventory space
- Added volume configurations to some noises I find a bit irritating at full volume
- Permanent Buffs, like those from right-clickable furniture, stay on a character even after death or after leaving a world!
- When you pick up keys you already have in keychains, they will try to stack into keychains first now!
- Added "Can be put in a keychain" tooltip for eligible items
- Made Golden Keys from within Keychains able to unlock Old Shaking Chests
- New Keys to summon Mimics
- Added, then removed support for Thorium :3
- Also supports Calamity, but I did nothing for it. If there are issues, let me know so I can remove this text!
- New mod calls for people wanting to support my mod!


- Finish vanity set
