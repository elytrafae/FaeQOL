My Quality of Life mod!

This mod currently only adds one item: The Keychain!
This item lets you hold keys inside, and said keys can be used to open things like chests and doors from within the keychain.

Currently only supports the vanilla chest keys and the Jungle Temple key, but cross-mod support is planned, and there is also a Mod.Call system for adding your own mod's keys!

API information will be compiled shortly.
